## Protein Synthesis CAT

📌 “One gene codes for one polypeptide” is correct at the fundamental level however some genes in eukaryotes can code for various types of polypeptides.

Explain how one gene codes for one (specific) polypeptide. In your explanation describe the process of protein synthesis (that is, transcription and translation). Include an annotated diagram demonstrating how one gene leads to one type of polypeptide.

In your step by step description of transcription show **how it is possible for some genes to code for variations in polypeptides**.

You will hand your research in and then sit a 40-minute validation test to demonstrate what you have learnt. It will be a summary of the process. (**Aim for 15-20 steps**).
