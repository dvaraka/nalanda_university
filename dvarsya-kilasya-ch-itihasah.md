_Written by the Keeper of the Keys, my greatest advisor_

While as grand and vast as Nalanda University is, situated among the greatest forests of invaluable knowledge and precious truth, like all great things it came from rather humble beginnings.

The first time I came across the great Commissioner, he was just another lonely merchant, by the name of Harzavad. 

Lonely as he was, by this time one could tell he had already seen a great many things and had journeyed a great many places, many of which would be described to me in great detail. 

If one would be deemed to say of his settlings, honesty would have to reveal that as always with the seemingly mystical, it was a chance of pure luck and hopeful promise, for I had become lost on my great travels and was simply yearning for a place of comfort in that vast expanse.

And kindly was my meeting with him, and he gave me room and sustenance for the time being. And in my time there I learned a great many things, for he showed me his countless wares and adventures.

I would like to think I was among the first to truly encounter and learn of the great world's treasures from this wondrous sorcery of stories, but it's likely that given his already expansive experience, I was but just another eager traveler awaiting his expertise.

And so I left with a much larger appreciation for the life and world around me, and my work and days improved quite drastically, all from a chance meeting with such an unassuming man.

The next time I met him, it seemed he had found a great many changes.

For one, he was not such a lonely merchant anymore but had seemingly stumbled upon a great many others of his caliber and knowledge. But so subjective is his terming of 'seemingly', for one can tell that 'chance' happenings with the folk of his kind were not quite as random if the stars had a say. 

He had settled in a quaint Town, it seemed, a place of a small yet strongly-knit community, and I found to my great liking the many wonders he and they had created in their little land of their own. Every great establishment in the world would've been put to shame with the great vastness of the subjects and unconventional intellect that had been infused into their libraries and their works. One could tell that it would be virtually impossible for any person of simple mind to not come out of that place yearning more, and yet still being able to receive an ever-growing amount of knowledge.

For generous were these people, far more willing in their charity than the scars of the world most likely deserved. A great many other travelers I met in my time there, and through Harzavad I would meet a great many who had learnt there and taken their learnings and studies into the great world to do good deeds of impossible measure.

As ever kindly these people were, the merchant let me write for his stores, which were still up and flowing with invaluable knowledge. And write I did, yet no words, simple or expansive, could describe the works of majesty here, though I did valiantly try. I was even shown the insides of their hearts and soles which were their studies, though many of which were far too innovative for my limited experience.

It had not been too many times and stories since I had left that place, but as I learned to my utter dismay, it seems that even those who are golden-hearted and indestructible inevitably fall into the hands of humanity's greed.

For with their charity, they paid the price because of whose secrets those good people had risked their livelihoods to reveal. The great land of knowledge was eventually laid waste by those with a higher hand, though fortunately, all the people were able to leave with most of their learnings and studies intact, wise as they were with their mechanics and technologies.

The Merchant has since moved on, though of course the studies of that community still remain as tight-knit as ever today. And I ventured to his latest institute, the powerful hub of knowledge and insight that is now Nalanda University. As deep and rich of a culture that lay within its foundations and throne, one was not of great enough learnings to appreciate the vast history that lay in its walls. But anyone of mind would be able to do nothing but stare in wonder and its majestic visage, as one did as I first arrived. Especially its depictions of past beasts that roamed the world, particularly a large sort of flightless bird that the Merchant revealed to me was akin to a spirit animal in his belief, a part of nature's past that developed from a humble past and seemingly dismal abilities, and yet thrived as what it eventually became. Now he is known as the great Dvaraka, known across the lands as an innovator and bringer of wisdom and enlightenment. But after all this time one can't help but wonder whether that was ever his real title, for if so then it seems fate had been with him all this time, following his footsteps in the warm desert sand...

All one could do for now is aid the Commissioner in his journey through time, in the mission of his and those of the Town, and to hold and pass down the keys of that which may be the only thing known to man that can retain a chance at immortality: the enlightenment of those who came, who are, and who will inevitably be, and the pursuit of the truth.
